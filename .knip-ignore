# Why certain dependencies appear unused to knip but are actually needed:

# @types/google.maps
# Provides TypeScript type definitions for Google Maps API that are used globally
# throughout the app (google.maps.*). These types are declared in types/google-maps.d.ts
# and used in components like DestinationSearch, DebugMap, and utils/googleMaps.ts

# tailwindcss
# Core library for Tailwind CSS v4. While we only directly import @tailwindcss/postcss
# in postcss.config.mjs, tailwindcss is a peer dependency that contains the actual
# CSS processing engine. Run `npm list tailwindcss` to see the dependency tree.
